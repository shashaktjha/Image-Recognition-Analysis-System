# Image-Recognition-Analysis-System

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to accurately identify the
context of an image and describe it in human language
(English). It uses concepts of Deep Learning, Natural Language
Processing, Computer Vision, and Python.
